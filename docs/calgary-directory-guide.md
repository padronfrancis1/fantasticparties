# Calgary Business Directory Listings Guide

## NAP Consistency (CRITICAL)

**NAP** stands for **Name, Address, Phone**. Consistency across all online directories is one of the most important factors for local SEO. Search engines use NAP data to verify your business legitimacy and determine local search rankings. Even small differences (like "Street" vs "St" or different phone formats) can confuse search engines and hurt your rankings.

These three platforms have the biggest impact on local SEO and customer discovery. Complete these within the first week.

### 1. Google Business Profile

**URL**: https://business.google.com/

**Why This Matters Most**: Google Business Profile is the #1 factor for local search rankings. It powers Google Maps results and the local "3-pack" that appears at the top of search results. 76% of people who search for a local business on their phone visit within 24 hours.

**Setup Steps**:

1. Visit https://business.google.com/ and sign in with a Gmail account
2. Click "Add your business to Google"
3. Enter business name: **Fantastic Parties YYC**

8. Add phone: **403-918-5507**
9. Add website: **https://www.fantasticparties.ca/**

### NAP Audit (Every 3 Months)

**Purpose**: Ensure your business information is consistent everywhere online. Inconsistencies hurt SEO.

**How to Audit**:

1. **Google Your Business**:
   - Search "Fantastic Parties YYC"
   - Search "Fantastic Parties Calgary"
   - Search "403-918-5507"
   - Note every site where your business appears

2. **Check Key Directories**:
   - Google Business Profile
   - Yelp
   - Facebook
   - YellowPages.ca
   - Canada411
   - Hotfrog
   - Cylex
   - Any others where you're listed

3. **Verify Exact Match**:
   - Business name: **Fantastic Parties YYC** (not variations)
   - Phone: **403-918-5507** (not alternate formats)
   - Website: **https://www.fantasticparties.ca/** (with https and trailing slash)
   - Email: **fantasticpartiesyyc@gmail.com**

4. **Fix Inconsistencies**:
   - Log into each directory and update
   - If you can't access a listing, contact the directory support
   - For data aggregators (like Neustar/Acxiom), submit corrections

5. **Remove Duplicate Listings**:
   - If multiple listings exist for your business on one platform, contact support to merge/remove duplicates
   - Duplicates dilute your SEO and confuse customers

**Timeline**: Quarterly audit (Months 3, 6, 9, 12). Budget 2 hours per audit.

---

### Review Response Strategy

**Why Reviews Matter**:
- 93% of consumers read online reviews before choosing a business
- Google weighs review quantity, recency, and responses in local rankings
- One negative review can deter 22% of potential customers

**Review Generation Strategy**:

1. **Ask at the Right Time**: Send review request 1-2 days after party (when positive experience is fresh)
2. **Make It Easy**: Provide direct links to Google/Yelp/Facebook review pages
3. **Text Template**:
   ```
   Hi [Name]! We hope [Child's Name] had an amazing party! If you were happy with our service, we'd love if you could leave a quick review. It helps other Calgary families find us!

   Google: [link]
   Facebook: [link]

   Thanks so much!
   - Fantastic Parties YYC
   ```
4. **Email Template**: Same message, formatted for email
5. **Don't Incentivize**: Offering discounts for reviews violates most platform policies
6. **Track Requests**: Keep log of who you asked and when (don't ask twice)

**Response Templates**:

**5-Star Review Response**:
```
Thank you so much, [Name]! We're thrilled [Child's Name] had such a great birthday! It was a pleasure working with you, and we hope to help celebrate many more milestones. Thanks for choosing Fantastic Parties YYC! 🎉
```

**4-Star Review Response**:

## Final Tips

1. **Consistency Over Perfection**: It's better to complete all Priority 1 directories well than to half-finish all of them. Focus on Google first.

2. **NAP is Non-Negotiable**: Double-check every single listing for exact NAP match. One wrong digit in your phone number on 5 directories could cost you rankings.

3. **Reviews are Gold**: A business with 20 reviews will outrank a business with 0 reviews even if the latter has better SEO otherwise. Prioritize review generation.

4. **Be Patient**: SEO takes 3-6 months to show significant results. Don't get discouraged if you're not #1 on Google after Week 1.

5. **Track Your Sources**: Ask every customer "How did you hear about us?" Keep a log. After 3 months, you'll know which directories are worth maintaining vs which to ignore.

6. **Mobile Optimization**: 70% of local searches happen on mobile. Ensure your listings look good on phones (especially Google Business Profile).

7. **Don't Pay for Listings (Yet)**: Start with free listings. Once you have proven ROI from bookings, then consider paid upgrades to YellowPages premium, Thumbtack leads, etc.

8. **Leverage User-Generated Content**: When customers post photos of their parties with your equipment, ask permission to repost. This provides fresh content and social proof.

9. **Seasonal Content**: Update your listings with seasonal messaging (summer: outdoor parties, winter: school gyms/community centers).

10. **Build Relationships**: Local SEO is about more than algorithms. Genuine relationships with customers, community groups, and local businesses will drive referrals and long-term success.
